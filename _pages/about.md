I’m an interdisciplinary information scientist specializing in privacy, human-AI interaction, and normative AI governance, with a particular focus on risk management and the future of work and healthcare. Grounded in a decade of work in organizational analytics and enterprise information systems, where I implemented governance programs and emerging technologies for workforce management and healthcare, my research develops pathways to align AI policy and practice with human values in contexts of rapid innovation and operational complexity. I bridge mixed methods with normative theory to identify and measure risks in applied AI and design socio-technical interventions to mitigate them. I completed my PhD in Information at the University of Michigan.  You can reach me at <roemmich@umich.edu>.
