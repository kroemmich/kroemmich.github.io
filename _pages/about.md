I am an interdisciplinary information scientist and AI governance strategist with over 15 years of combined academic and professional experience aligning technology, policy, people, and processes for organizations to address the social, ethical, and regulatory risks of digital systems. With a background in ERP systems design, implementation, and governance for workforce management and healthcare systems, I bring enterprise-level insight into how organizations can translate technical, functional, and regulatory requirements into operational AI policy and practice. Through collaboration with policymakers, advocacy groups, cross-disciplinary experts, and industry leaders, I bridge research and enterprise strategy to make responsible AI actionable, scalable, and trusted.

Focusing on normative AI governance and risk management for responsible AI innovation, my mixed-methods research specializes in human-AI interaction and the future of work. I advance rigorous risk assessment and measurement approaches to create evidence-based frameworks that anticipate and mitigate regulatory, ethical, and privacy risks, and align AI policy and practice with human values. My award-winning work is published in leading computing venues such as ACM CHI and CSCW, featured in outlets including Business Insider, and has informed policy and rulemaking at state, national, and international levels. I hold a PhD from the University of Michigan School of Information.
