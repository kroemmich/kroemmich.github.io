I am an AI ethics, privacy, and policy scientist and governance strategist with over 15 years of experience aligning technology design and policy with organizational requirements and people processes to build responsible, human-centered socio-technical systems. With a background in ERP systems design, implementation, and governance across labor and health domains, I bring enterprise-level insight into how organizations can translate technical, functional, and regulatory requirements into operational AI policy and practice. Through collaboration with policymakers, advocacy groups, cross-disciplinary experts, and industry leaders, I bridge research and enterprise strategy to make responsible AI actionable, scalable, and trusted.

Specializing in normative AI governance and risk management, my research advances methods for risk assessment and measurement to create evidence-based frameworks and policies that identify, mitigate, and anticipate ethical and privacy risks, supporting responsible innovation. My award-winning work has been published in leading computing venues such as ACM CHI and CSCW, featured in outlets including Business Insider, and has informed policy and rulemaking at state, national, and international levels. I hold a PhD from the University of Michigan School of Information.
