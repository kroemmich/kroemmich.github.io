I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan School of Information.  Broadly, I'm interested in privacy, tech ethics, and marginalization.  My current research focus examines the privacy and ethical implications of emotion AI technologies and applications in various contextual domains, including social media, healthcare, and the workplace.
