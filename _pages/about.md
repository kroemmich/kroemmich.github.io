I am an AI ethics, privacy, and policy scientist and governance strategist with 15+ years of experience aligning technology design and policy with operational requirements and people processes to deliver responsible, human-centered socio-technical systems. Specializing in normative AI governance and risk management, my research develops evidence-based frameworks to identify and mitigate ethical and privacy risks, advances novel risk measurement methods, and informs policy and rulemaking at both state and international levels.

Drawing on a background in ERP systems design, implementation, and governance across labor and health domains, I bring enterprise-level insight into how organizations can translate technical, functional, and regulatory requirements into operational AI policy and practice. Through collaboration with policymakers, advocacy groups, and industry leaders, I bridge research and enterprise strategy to ensure that responsible AI is actionable, scalable, and trusted.
