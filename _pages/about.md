I'm an interdisciplinary information scientist and AI governance strategist specializing in the translation gap between AI policy and organizational practice. My work addresses a critical challenge: while governance frameworks proliferate, organizations struggle to implement them operationally. I develop evidence-based methods, risk assessment tools, and governance strategies to make AI oversight actionable and scalable.

My research intersects human-AI interaction, the future of work, and normative AI governance and risk management. I use mixed methods to evaluate AI use cases, develop assessment approaches that identify, measure, mitigate, and anticipate regulatory, ethical, and privacy risks, and align AI policy and practice with human values, organizational goals, and societal needs. My award-winning work is published in leading computing venues such as ACM CHI and CSCW, featured in outlets including Business Insider, and has informed policy and rulemaking at state, national, and international levels. 

Before my PhD from the University of Michigan School of Information, I spent a decade designing, implementing, and governing ERP systems for workforce management and healthcare. My experiences navigating organizational complexities, competing priorities, and change management challenges shape how I approach AI governance. This enterprise-level perspective distinguishes my research and advisory work, narrowing gaps between aspiration and execution.  I work across research, policy, and enterprise contexts because effective AI governance requires it. I engage with policymakers to translate empirical insights into policy interventions, with industry leaders to advance responsible innovation, and with the public and advocacy groups to ensure governance reflects diverse stakeholder needs—especially those most impacted by AI systems. Across all of this work, my overarching goal is ensuring that AI governance delivers tangible benefits and protections for affected people and communities.
