excerpt: ' Pointing to tensions between company claims and broader algorithmic fairness and equity scholarship, we argue that EAI service claims dangerously obscure the potential harms introduced by EAI and reinforce exclusionary hiring practices despite their concurrent claims of debiasing hiring processes
and outcomes. Lastly, we discuss this workâ€™s implications for design and policy to address deception and unfairness in EAI hiring services.'
